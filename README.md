# Office365Prerequisites
Install all the required Office 365 and Azure PowerShell modules at once

Updated - 23-12-2019
Added Exchange Online V2 module
Updated Sharepoint Online Powershell module url
Added Teams PowerShell module
Added AZ PowerShell module
Added InTune PowerShell module
Added StaffHub PowerShell module
This script will install all the required modules for Sharepoint Online, AzureAD, Skype Online and Teams.
Exchange Online V2 will allow you to connect to EXO without installing the module from the EXO portal.

I did include the method to install it, at this point it is unclear to me if it will be depricated in the future or combined.

The required Visual Studio C++ 2017 will also be downloaded and installed.
This is required for the Skype Online PowerShell module.
